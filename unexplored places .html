            <h3>MALUTI TEMPLE, JHARKHAND</h3>
            <p>Maluti temples are a group of 72 extant terracotta temples (out of the original number of 108),[1] located in the Maluti
            village near Shikaripara in Dumka district on the eastern part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, Indian state of
            Jharkhand.[2] These temples, according to the Indian Trust for Rural Heritage and Development (ITRHD), were built
            between the 17th and 19th centuries. The kings of Baj Basanta dynasty built these temples in Maluti, their capital,
            inspired by goddess Mowlakshi, their family deity. Many of the temples are deified with different denominations of gods
            and goddesses, apart from the tutelary deity Mowlakshi, and others such as Shiva, Durga, Kali and Vishnu. The Global
            Heritage Fund (GHF) has proposed a conservation effort, which would increase tourism to the Maluti village. GHF has
            declared this site as one of the world's 12 most endangered cultural heritage sites.</p>

            <h3>ARAVELAM ROCK CUT, GOA</h3>
            <p>Apart from the admirable beaches and waterfalls, Goa is also one of the most sought after destinations for heritage
            architectures. Goa is an ancient state and so is the architecture found here. A beautiful example of the historical
            monuments present in Goa is the Arvalem Caves or the “Pandava Caves”. Located in the Bicholim town of North Goa, these
            caves are ancient rock cut caves that give us a chance to steep into the mythological tales. The origin of these caves
            dates back to the 6th century.
            
            Popularly known as the Pandava Caves, these caves have derived their name from the five Pandavas of the epic
            Mahabharata. As the legend has it, the Pandavas sought refuge in these caves during their exile. The presence of five
            compartments and Shivlingas in the cave complex provides relevance of this fact. However, the caves have also been
            claimed to be of Buddhist origin due to presence of a huge statue of Buddha near the place. The architectural style of
            the caves also speaks loud of the Buddhist possession. The opinions regarding the origin of the caves have been
            ambivalent from years.</p>

            <h3>MASRUR TEMPLE, HIMACHAL PRADESH</h3>
            <p>The Masrur Temples, also referred to as Masroor Temples or Rock-cut Temples at Masrur, is an early 8th-century complex
            of rock-cut Hindu temples in the Kangra Valley of Beas River in Himachal Pradesh, India.[2] The temples face northeast,
            towards the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas.[1] They are a version of North Indian Nagara architecture style,
            dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, Devi and Saura traditions of Hinduism, with its surviving iconography likely inspired by a
            henotheistic framework.
            <br>
            Though a major temples complex in the surviving form, the archaeological studies suggest that the artists and architects
            had a far more ambititious plan and the complex remains incomplete. Much of the Masrur's temple's sculpture and reliefs
            have been lost. They were also quite damaged, most likely from earthquakes.[</p>
